# Control PC with controller

# What this?
This is an app that let's you control your pc with a controller.  It's self explanatory. this only works on Windows.

# How to download
So, you want to download this. I'll tell you how. First you download the app [here.](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iu3fi3pykmqkkwy/control-pc-with-controller.zip/file) Then you extract the .zip file. After that, you run control-pc-with-controller.exe. You will get an admin popup, but the app will do nothing to your pc (you can look in the script up top if you don't believe me). The app need admin to use the on screen keyboard. If you want the app to always to run every time you boot up your pc, then you right click on control-pc-with-controller.vbs and select edit (if you don't see this, then you first need to left click on it). Then you replace path-to-exe with the path to control-pc-with-controller.exe. Then you drag and drop control-pc-with-controller.vbs into the startup folder. Note that you do need a mouse to click on yes when the admin prompt pop ups everytime. you can disable it [with this article](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-run-everything-in-administrator-mode-and-why-you-shouldnt-do-it/), but I don't recommend doing it.

# How to use
Press (xbox: LB, RB, LT, RT) (DS4: L1, R1, L2, R2) (switch: L, R, LZ, RZ) at the same time to enabled/disabled it. To left click, press (xbox: A) (DS4: X) (switch: B).
